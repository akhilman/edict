//!
//! ## Edict
//! is experimental ECS with ref-counted entities and built-in change detection
//! written in Rust by your fellow ðŸ¦€
//!
//! ### Features
//! Counting references to individual entities adds few desirable properties.
//!
//! For one, strong entity reference guarantees that enitity it referes to is alive.
//! This allows providing non-fallible API to fetch data attached to entities.
//!
//! Another one is automatic entity despawn when no one references the entity.
//! This may seem as a step backward, as most ECS tend to require manual entity despawn,
//! allowing entities to just sit in the [`World`] and be queried by systems.
//! This may lead to problems when encoding ownership of an entity by another.
//! If references to owned entities are stored in owner's component,
//! then despawning the owner will break the relationship,
//! code that despawns the owner may be unaware about component that holds refrences to owned entitites.
//! This will leave previously owned entities orphaned. Hence owned entity must store a reference to its owner
//! and check periodically if owner was despawned.
//!
//! With Edict owner stores strong references ([`Entity`]) to owned entities.
//! When strong reference is dropped - possibly together with the component on despawn -
//! the entity will be despawned if no other strong references left.
//!
//! Edict provides [`EntityId`] reference type which works as entity references in traditional ECS.
//!
//! Another feature of Edict is integrated change detection.
//! It tracks when components are accessed mutably and may efficiently iterate through modified components.
//! "Modified when?" Careful reader may inquire.
//! Imagine a game loop, where a set of systems run on each cycle.
//! If system has a query over modified components, it probably wants to see all modifications
//! since it ran this query last time.
//! Edict offeers [`Tracks`] type. Created simply with [`World::tracks()`],
//! this type is used in all queries that checks for components modification.
//! [`Tracks`] instance inform the query, that that modifications occured
//! since the last use of this [`Tracks`] instance should be returned by query.
//! On the first use of [`Tracks`] returnd from [`World::tracks()`] all components are considered to be modified.
//! [`World::tracks_now()`] returns [`Tracks`] instance
//! for which all modifications happened prior [`World::tracks_now()`] call to be obsolete.
//!
//! ### no_std support
//!
//! Edict supports `no_std` environment, but requires `alloc`.
//! With `"std"` feature error types implement `Error` trait,
//! apart from that only few internal pieces depend on `"std"` feature.
//! `"std"` feature is enabled by default and must be turned off for `no_std` environemnt.
//! Dependent crates that also support `no_std` should use `default-features = false` for `edict` dependency,
//! and optionally enable `"std"` if needed.
//!
//! [`World`]: `edict::world::World`
//! [`Entity`]: `edict::entity::Entity`
//! [`EntityId`]: `edict::entity::EntityId`
//! [`Tracks`]: `edict::tracks::Tracks`
//! [`World::tracks()`]: `edict::world::World::tracks`
//! [`World::tracks_now()`]: `edict::world::World::tracks_now`
